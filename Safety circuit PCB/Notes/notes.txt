      Notes:
        This is a Dual N-Channel MOSFET, even though the schematic and the odd
        number of MOSFETs suggests that we want to use single N-Channel MOSFETs.
        Therefore, I plan to choose a different surface mount NMOS - Jacoby

Personal Comments and Suggestions:
  Increasing Resistances on Resistors from NMOS gates to ground:
    The resistors on the gates of the MOSFETs should be quite high, probably
    on the order of megaohms, so that
    they draw little current and, for a given voltage, draw little power (think
    P = V^2/R. If we make R high and V is capped at 12V, then P will go extremely
    low.)
    I propose that we use the CRCW080510M0FKEA (details and datasheet below). It
    has a resistance of 10 MOhms and a power rating of 250 mW.

Questions:
  Are the BOTS and OUTPUT nodes supposed to be the same node?
